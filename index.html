					I gave it all up to make my wife happy. That's right. We've moved to Tucson, Arizona,
					to be with her family, particularly with her widowed mother.
				</p>

				<p>Yes, I quit my job, and sold our house. The move has taken place, we're settled in. I'm employed at Well Fargo Bank where I spend my time writing and supporting data center-related applications.

						Yes. But not this one.</span>
				</h2>
				<p>So without futher delay let me introduce myself. My name is Anthony Ferlazzo.
					I come from humble beginnings. My parents were so poor that I didn't get a middle name.

			<div class="col-md-5 col-md-push-1 col-sm-6">
				<h2 class="space-before">But wait! There's more...</h2>
				<p>
					That's right. Although I didn't get a middle name I did get a college degree! So tick that off the list
					Mr. H.R. Head. But of course we all say that a degree is meaningless in terms of being able to code. I
					guess the biggest benefit to getting my degree is that I learned to get the job done even after the thrill
					was gone. I demonstrated that I could go after a goal that took a sizable effort over a considerable amount
					of time and not give up just because the going got tough.
